## 2.0.0+focale.1

Focale fork of 2.0.0. Upstream structure, plus:

- `MainAppShellCapture` no longer walks the whole main view after every frame. It keeps the element of the entry widget it found and walks again only once that element is unmounted.
- Linux. Activating a window blocked by a modal dialog hands keyboard focus back to that dialog, so typing never reaches the blocked window.
- Linux. Window close paths never quit the application. The host keeps the GApplication alive until the shared engine has stopped (Focale ADR 0252).

## 2.0.0

- Breaking. Native window calls go through FFI instead of MethodChannel. Many
  `MultiViewDesktop` methods are now synchronous (no `await`): title, chrome,
  min/max, visibility, focus, alwaysOnTop, and similar. Keep `await` for
  `openWindow` / `openDialog` / `close*` / `setSize` / `setPosition` /
  `setAlignment` / `center` / `setAspectRatio` and popup open-close
- `PopupView` on macOS, Windows, and Linux (X11). Disabled on Wayland: popup
  needs client-side positioning (`GDK_BACKEND=x11`)
- Window and popup animations (`ViewAnimationConfig`, `AnimationSettings`,
  `setForceAnimation`)
- Deferred show via `showOnInit: false` + `completeShow()`
- Optional file logger (`MultiAppConfig.fileLogParams` / `LogParams`)
- `MultiViewDesktop.screen` for connected displays. Physical window bounds
  (`getPhysicalBounds` / `setPhysicalBounds`) for mixed-DPI layouts

  mode is `destroy`
